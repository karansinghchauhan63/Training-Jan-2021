    The main function of a leaf is to produce food for the plant by photosynthesis.
    Chlorophyll, the substance that gives plants their characteristic green colour,
    absorbs light energy. The internal structure of the leaf is protected by the leaf epidermis,
    which is continuous with the stem epidermis. The central leaf, or mesophyll, consists of
    soft-walled,
    unspecialized cells of the type known as parenchyma. As much as one-fifth of the mesophyll is
    composed of chlorophyll-containing chloroplasts, which absorb sunlight and, in conjunction with
    certain enzymes, use the radiant energy in decomposing water into its elements,
    hydrogen and oxygen.
